  San Juan Island Fire and Rescue is governed by San Juan County Fire District
  3. The state of Washington chartered San Juan Island Fire Department in May of
  1959.


  In Washington, special purpose districts are limited purpose local governments separate from a city, town, or county government. Generally, they perform limited functions including fire protection, that are not otherwise available from city or county governments.


  San Juan County Fire District 3 has an elected, three member board of commissioners who serve a six-year term ([RCW 52.14.060](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=52.14.060)). Most special purpose districts in Washington, including San Juan County District 3, derive revenues from real property assessments and are called taxing districts.


  Fire District #3 operates as directed by applicable laws and regulations set by the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) and the Washington Administrative Code (WAC).


  The RCW is the compilation of all permanent laws now in force. It is a collection of Session Laws (enacted by the Legislature, and signed by the Governor, or enacted via the initiative process). The WAC includes the regulations of executive branch agencies issued by authority of statutes. Like legislation and the Constitution, *regulations are a source of primary law* in Washington State. The WAC codifies the regulations and arranges them by subject or agency.


  ### Current Commissioners


  * Dwight Colley (Chair)

  * Warren Appleton (Vice-Chair)

  * Aï»¿lexa Rust


  ### Board Meetings


  Board meetings are open to the public and regularly scheduled meetings are held on the second Tuesday of every month, at 3:00 PM at the Fire District headquarters, located at Fire Station #31 at 1011 Mullis Street in Friday Harbor.


  ### District


  SJIF&R provides emergency response to all of San Juan Island, including Town of Friday Harbor, as well as Brown, Henry, Johns, Pearl, Spieden, and Stuart Islands.
