  ## Wildfire Risk


  Every year, wildfires burn across the United States, and a growing number of

  people are living where wildfires are a real risk. Each year, wildfires have

  burned in the San Juan Islands. We’ve been fortunate that our firefighters

  with the support of crews from the Department of Natural Resources have been

  able to quickly stop the growth of the wildfires. Our moderate summer

  temperatures along with the moisture contained in the undergrowth has helped

  us avoid a large wildfire event. This may not always be the case, everyone

  needs to take steps to keep their home and the area surrounding their home

  prepared to withstand a spreading wildfire.


  ## What is Firewise?


  [Firewise

  USA](https://www.nfpa.org/Public-Education/Fire-causes-and-risks/Wildfire/Firewise-USA)

  is a national program that teaches and encourages homeowners and residents to

  take steps to protect their home by managing vegetation and debris near their

  home and so provide a ‘fire-safe’ zone in the event of a wildfire in their

  area.


  ## Firewise Locally


  Currently, Firewise on the islands consists of twenty-eight active

  communities each with a designated leader who have made the commitment to

  maintain the area around their homes using the [recommendations set forth by

  Firewise

  USA](https://www.nfpa.org/Public-Education/Fire-causes-and-risks/Wildfire/Preparing-homes-for-wildfire).

  ## Why Join?


  Engaging your community and taking action to follow the recommended guidelines

  can significantly reduce the damage a wildfire can have on homes and

  outbuildings. Signing up as a community can be started at any time of the

  year. [Click here](https://www.nfpa.org/Public-Education/Fire-causes-and-risks/Wildfire/Firewise-USA/Become-a-Firewise-USA-site.)

  to get started or you can [contact us directly](/contact/) for assistance.


  ## What Firewise Entails?


  A Firewise community meets once per year to discuss goals accomplished and to

  set goals for the new year. Each year the leader of each community completes

  an online report of actions taken along with the monetary value of those

  actions taken. For example, several homeowners can hire a tree specialist to

  remove limbs and trees in order to provide better driveway clearance for

  emergency vehicles, and then the cost of the labor and the monetary value of

  the time spent in helping with the clean-up is reported to the firewise

  community leader. The leader then records this action taken on the [firewise

  reporting portal](https://portal.firewise.org/user/login).


  Our San Juan regional coordinator works with each community as needed to

  assist with completing a Community Wildfire Risk Assessment. The coordinator

  also helps to coordinate individual home Wildfire Risk Evaluations. All

  homeowners, firewise or not, are encouraged to invite SJIF&R to complete an

  evaluation of the property surrounding a home. [Contact us](/contact) to setup

  an appointment.
