  ## Mutual Aid Relationships

  We work closely with our neighboring fire districts, San Juan Island EMS, San Juan County’s Sheriff Department, and the San Juan County Fire Marshal, as well as state and federal emergency services agencies.

  SJIF&R fulfills formal contracts with the Washington State Department of Natural Resources ([DNR](https://www.dnr.wa.gov/FightingFire)) to provide both pre-hospital care and fire coverage to outer islands in our archipelago, and has informal arrangements to respond in support of the US Coast Guard Bellingham Station.

  SJIF&R participates in the statewide [Fire Service Resource Mobilization Plan](https://www.wsp.wa.gov/all-risk-mobilization/), sending one or more wildland fire crews to support communities throughout the western United States.
