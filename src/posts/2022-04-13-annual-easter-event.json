  "lede": "SJIF&R and the San Juan Island Firefighters Association will host the annual Easter Egg Event this Sunday, **April 17th from Noon to 2:00 p.m.**",
  "body": "We hope you will join us for a fun walk around town, visit with some of our firefighters, and keep an eye out for the Easter Bunny!\n\nFamilies will follow a route around Spring Street, looking for firefighters positioned outside certain businesses. They will stamp your passport and you can visit the Easter Bunny in the Wells Fargo parking lot for a prize when you’ve collected all the stamps. The course will be shortened from last year because of the fire on Spring Street.\n\n\n[Download the passport book](https://www.sjifire.org/assets/docs/easter_walk_2022.pdf).  If you don’t have a printer, no problem!  We’ll have extra passports at the start. \n\nWe hope to see you hopping around town this Sunday. Have fun and thank you for keeping this new island tradition alive!",
