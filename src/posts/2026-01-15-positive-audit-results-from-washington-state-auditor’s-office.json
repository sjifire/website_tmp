These results affirm the District’s ongoing commitment to transparency, accountability, and responsible stewardship of public funds.\n\n\n**Key Audit Highlights:**\n\n* Full Compliance: The SAO found District operations complied with state requirements and internal policies in all material respects.\n\n* Public Trust: Independent audits provide essential accountability and transparency, ensuring taxpayers can trust that public resources are managed responsibly.\n\n* Areas Reviewed: Payroll, accounts payable, treasury activities, open public meetings, financial condition, and annual report submissions were examined as part of the audit.\n\n\nWhile the audit identified certain payroll-related control improvements, these were communicated in a management letter and are already being addressed by the District. Recommendations include formalizing written payroll policies and strengthening documentation and monitoring processes.\n\n\n**Commitment to Continuous Improvement:**\nFire Chief Noel Monin stated, \"We take our responsibility to safeguard public resources very seriously. The positive audit results reflect our dedication to accountability and transparency. We appreciate the Auditor’s recommendations and are implementing improvements to further strengthen our internal controls.\"\n\n\nFire Commissioner Dwight Colley stated, \"I am not surprised by these positive audit results. Through the consistent oversight provided during our regular Board meetings and the diligence of the District’s administrative staff—particularly our Finance Officer—we have maintained strong practices that ensure public resources are managed responsibly.\"\n\nThe District serves approximately 9,400 residents across San Juan, Brown, Dinner, Henry, Pearl, Stuart, Johns, Speiden and O’Neil Islands, operating with a combination of nine full and part-time employees and over 40 volunteer firefighters and support members.
