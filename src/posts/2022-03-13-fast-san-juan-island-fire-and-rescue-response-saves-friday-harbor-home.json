  "lede": "On Friday afternoon, March 11, 2022, San Juan Island Fire and Rescue (SJIF&R) crews received a page from a 911 call regarding reports of fire at a home in the Town of Friday Harbor.",
  "body": "The first engine crew arrived on the scene in minutes and came upon an active exterior fire with heavy smoke, and the fire had already spread onto a covered entryway, as well as enveloping some materials stored alongside the home. \n\nSJIF&R fire crews rapidly deployed the engine’s hose line and were able to extinguish the fire, which had begun to spread onto the roof line of the home. Additional fire personnel and resources arrived and entered the home’s interior to ensure the fire had not spread internally. Fire crews deployed fans to ventilate the home’s interior and extricate smoke and particulate matter. After ventilation, crews remained on scene to help the homeowners by covering the entryway from further damage from weather.\n\nNo people or animals were inside the home at the time of the fire and there were no injuries during the emergency response. Residents were receiving assistance from the American Red Cross. The cause of the fire was accidental. \n\nThe emergency response was successful and partner agencies actively assisted by provided support during this incident.",
